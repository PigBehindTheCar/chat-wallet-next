## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PigBehindTheCar/chat-wallet-next.git
cd chat-wallet-next
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Configure API base URL (optional)

The default API base URL is `http://localhost:8000`. If your backend service runs at a different address, please modify the `API_CONFIG.baseUrl` value in the `src/app/services/transactionService.ts` file:

```typescript
// API configuration
const API_CONFIG = {
	baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000", // Change to your backend service address
}
```

4. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Usage Instructions

### Adding Transactions

- Click the "+" button at the bottom of the interface to manually add a transaction
- Or type a natural language description in the input box (e.g., "Spent $50 on groceries on May 15th, 2025")

### Viewing Transaction History

- Click the date at the top to switch between years and months
- View transactions and financial summaries for specific time periods

### Editing/Deleting Transactions

- Click on any transaction item to edit it
- Click the delete icon on the right side of a transaction to delete it

## Backend Service

This application needs to connect to a backend API service for natural language processing and data storage. It's stored at [another github repo](https://github.com/DanielJones6736/NLP-Bookkeeping).
